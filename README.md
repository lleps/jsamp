# What is JSAMP
A project that provides a high-level java library to write SA:MP servers on java. Works using a [sampgdk plugin](https://github.com/Zeex/sampgdk) that will initialize a JVM instance then link Java api and SA-MP server.

# Requeriments
 * Have JDK 8 (or greater) <b>32-bit</b> installed.
