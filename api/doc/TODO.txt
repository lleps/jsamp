-Added plus and minus methods to vectors.

Player
    Ones which needs extra code:
        * freezed - a variable to store if player is freezed or not.
        * spawn position
        * attached objects - we need an array to find the first free slot, however, player can teorically contains infinite attached object.
        also attached objects must be loaded when player respawns.
        * weapons. I still have no idea of how to do it.
        * camera transition class
        * name - check for name change errors.
