Built-in support for enterable interiors.
Create methods setWorld in world entities for set only reference.

Vehicle listeners.
	  OnSpawn and recreate the vehicle here.
	  Add to VehicleComponent "price"
	  Add Modshop.getModshopByExteriorPosition()
	  Create onModded/Paintjob/ColorInModshop
	  Update these variables internally on Vehicle when players use modshops.
	  Add Optional getPlayerModshop
    * Create OnDeathListener, OnSirenState, OnEnter/ExitAnim/Ed, OnPlayerShootVehicle.
	* add vehicle.getDriver (optional - obviously!). To do it, GO TO ANTICHEAT AND HOOK GETPLAYERVEHICLEID with SOUHBE
	  check why onColor/PaintjobChangeListener dont works, maybe driver is wrong?
    * do organization based on projects and sub-projects
    * change names onplayerenter/exit and onplayershoot (names that sucks should be changed!)
      vehiclemode.getSeats
      Vehicle.getPlayerInSeat(Seat), Vehicle.getPlayersIn

First, i'll write all about worlds.
 * Refactor Entity to make independent of worlds. "Single responsibility principle - Do one thing."
 * Write and test all entities.
 * Write and test all world implementations.

Come back to think on this sheet's abstraction.
